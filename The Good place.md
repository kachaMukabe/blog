# Learning to love moral philosophy

I recently just finished The Good Place and I have to say I quite liked it.
It gave me quite an interesting epiphany about the afterlife, philosophy a new crush on Kristen Bell.

The character of Chidi Anagonye is probably my favourite character in the whole show. He opened my mind to moral philosophy and possibly a never ending search to find a not answer and I need to read the book what do we owe each other.

Season one was a pretty good start and probably the strongest part of the show meeting all the characters seeing all their chemistry (except for Jason, Jaoson is kinda the worst character).

Season two was...ok but I think it kinda started to lose it's steam with all the reboots. The reveal about it being the bad place was pretty good at the end of season one but it certainly wasn't as good as the first one but I couldn't stop watching so it definitely got something great.

Season three had a pretty good turn with our characters going back to earth and introducing new characters like Simone, her and Chidi were a pretty good couple. The middle part of the season was a bit of a lull like both season 2. It just wasn't great and I think a low point for me was the Janet fight with the rest of the demons.

Season four certainly stuck the landing most of the way I think. Them getting to the good place by creating a new system of judging humans was pretty good. It certainly made me think about how humans do get judged in such a binary way, at least on earth.

The final twist of the good place counsel people tricking Micheal into being leader of the good place was ... something. It was an interesting look at what an infinite paradise could do to people. What would you do if you had an infinite amount of time to do anything and can get anything you want. A pretty messed up happiness zombie.

The solution that they came up with was pretty interesting, creating a door that allows people in the afterlife to "die" once and for all, this could resolve my own problems with being able to live forever. The whole choose when you can go really got me, it was the first time I got a really positive feeling about Jason (which they sorta ruined a little later on). Having everyone choose to finally leave was a great ending, Tahani staying behind as an architect was I guess a bit meh but also kinda gives her character growth a corect trajectory.

As a final thought I think the good place is a great watch completely worth it and I think it has got me interested in reading one or two moral philosophy books.
